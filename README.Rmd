ftree is an experimental and mostly useless R package. It has one function, `ftree()` that shows a file tree on your console.

## Unix

Unicode doesn't quite work correctly..

```{r example}
## this doesn't render in Github Markdown
library(ftree)
ftree(path = system.file(package = "ftree"))
```

## Windows

Note that unicode rendering this doesn't seem to work well when with rmarkdown in Windows. However, it should display fine in the console. 

```{r console, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/console-screenshot-1.png")
```

Test emjoi rendering:

```{r}
emo::ji("folder")
```
